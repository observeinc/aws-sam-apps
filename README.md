## Getting Started

To begin using these applications, you'll need to have the AWS CLI and SAM CLI installed and configured. See below for quick instructions on building and deploying an application. For a full development guide, check out the `DEVELOPER.md` file.

### Prerequisites

- AWS CLI
- SAM CLI
- Docker (optional, for linting and local testing)

### Building and Deploying an Application

Navigate to an application's directory under `apps/` and use the SAM CLI to build and deploy:

```sh
cd apps/forwarder
sam build
sam deploy --guided
```

For more detailed instructions on building, deploying, and publishing applications, please see the corresponding documentation in the `docs` folder.

## Testing

To run tests, use the Go tooling:

```sh
go test ./...
```

For more comprehensive testing instructions, please refer to `DEVELOPER.md`.
